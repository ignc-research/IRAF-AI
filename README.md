## Readme
This code is a component for visualizing data in Angular using Plotly.js. It allows users to select and add different types of plots (i.e., trajectory plot, bar plot, line plot, or custom plot) based on their data. The component provides a UI with controls for managing data and plots, as well as adding custom plot definitions using Plotly.js.

## UI Controls
The UI provides the following controls for managing data and plots:

## Plot Controls
Select a plot: a dropdown list where the user can select the type of plot to add.
Custom Plot Definition: a textarea where the user can enter the Plotly.js code for a custom plot.
Add Plot: a button to add the selected plot to the workspace.
Custom Plot Definition
The Custom Plot Definition control allows users to define custom plots using Plotly.js. The Custom Plot option must be selected in the Select a plot control to enable this control. The user can then enter the Plotly.js code in the Custom Plot Definition textarea.

Users can find examples of Plotly.js custom plots on the Plotly.js documentation.

## Workspace
The workspace is the area where the added plots are displayed. Each added plot is represented by a wrapper that contains the plot and its specific controls. For custom plots, a textarea containing the Plotly.js code is also displayed.

## Import CSV
The Import CSV section provides a control to upload CSV files to the component. The user can import CSV files by clicking the Import CSV button and selecting the file to upload. Once a file is uploaded, its name is displayed in the Imported CSV Files list.

## Variable Definition
The Variable Definition control allows users to define and add global variables that can be used in custom plot definitions. The user can enter the variable definition in the Variable Definition textarea, and then click the Add Variable button to add it to the list of global variables.

## Dark Mode
The Dark Mode toggle button allows the user to switch the component to a dark mode. Clicking the button changes the background color of the workspace and controls.

## Custom Plots
The Custom Plot option allows users to define custom plots using Plotly.js. The user can enter the Plotly.js code in the Custom Plot Definition textarea.

The Custom Plot option allows for maximum flexibility in defining custom visualizations. Users can leverage the vast library of Plotly.js examples, including many examples of custom plots, on the Plotly.js documentation.

Once the user has defined a custom plot, the component will render it in the workspace. Custom plots are rendered using an HTML div with a unique ID that is generated by the component. The user can find this ID by inspecting the rendered HTML and use it to modify the custom plot via code.
